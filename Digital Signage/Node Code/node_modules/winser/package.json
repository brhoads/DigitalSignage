This is very helpfull because during development you don't want to install/uninstall the package as a windows service but you will often run \"npm install\" in the folder, then you can cancel with an 'n'.\n\nThe arguments in the **preuninstall** script means:\n\n-  x stop the service before uninstalling\n-  r remove the service\n-  s silent, don't display any information\n\n\n## Method 2\n\nAdd these two scripts to your package.json:\n\n```js\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"install-windows-service\": \"winser -i\",\n    \"uninstall-windows-service\": \"winser -r\"\n  }\n```\n\nThen you can install your service as:\n\n```bash\n  npm run-script install-windows-service\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you install your node.js program as a windows service, your program is registered using nssm.exe (which is inside the module folder). Once you start the service nssm.exe is run and nssm.exe will execute \"npm start\" of your application.\n\nRemember that the default npm action for \"start\" is \"node server.js\".\n\nThe name of the service will be the same from your package.json \"name\" setting.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is heavily inspired in \n\n - [Node.js on windows by Tatham Oddie](http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/2011/03/16/node-js-on-windows/)\n\nAnd it uses:\n\n - [nssm](http://nssm.cc)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jose Romaniello &lt;jfromaniello@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
